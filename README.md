I imagine My strategy will be to manually copy the Imgui source files I need and NOT clone Imgui as a submodule?

1) Create a sub-folder imgui?
2) Copy at least one backend imgui file?
3) Create a main.cpp (using some example file as a template to understand what I need to write)?
4) Consider to make my app specific window rendering into a seprate function?
